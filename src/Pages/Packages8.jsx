            Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah is the dargah (mausoleum) of the Sufi saint
            Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya (1238-1325 CE). Situated in the Nizamuddin
            West area of Delhi, the dargah is visited by thousands of pilgrims
            every week. The site is also known for its evening qawwali
            devotional music sessions

            Nizamuddin's tomb has a white dome. The main structure was built by
            Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1325, following Nizamuddin's death. Firuz
            Shah Tughlaq later repaired the structure and suspended four golden
            cups from the dome's recesses. Nawab Khurshid Jah of Hyderabadâ€™s
            legendary Paigah Family gifted the marble balustrade that surrounds
            the grave. The present dome was built by Faridun Khan in 1562. The
            structure underwent many additions over the years. The dome is about
            six metres in diameter. The dargah is surrounded by a marble patio
            and is covered with intricate jalis (transl. trellis walls). The
            dargah complex also has a wazookhana (transl. ablution area)
